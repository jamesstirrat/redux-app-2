# redux-app-2
Building a slightly more complex app with redux. 

//0. import createStore from redux
//1. Create store
//2. Create reducer that sits inside store
//3. Define initial state for reducer
//4. import Provider from react-redux
//5. Create separate component for functions and views outside of App.js
//6. Wrap (root level) component in a Provider
//7. mapStateToProps to access store from our component
//8. Import connect from react-redux
//9. Get rid of local state
//10. matchDispatchertoProps to establish dispatcher for actions. These actions will then go to functions in the reducer to change the app state
//11. Create a switch for reducing (changing our state) based on our different actions
